# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am a **Product Analytics Manager** with a clear mission to enable **impactful decisions** based on **insights from the data**.

Started my journey with analytics from the small data world (social services) and moved to big data ecosystems (finance, geodata and ecommerce) to leverage power of algorithms and computer science.

### Currently 
- building & scaling data teams
- implementing data science and machine learning capabilities into daily operations at ecommerce
- introducing an ‘analytics-as-a-product’ concept
- leading AI transformation & disseminating data-informed decision culture
